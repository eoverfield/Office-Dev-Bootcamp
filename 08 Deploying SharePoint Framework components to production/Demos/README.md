## Demos

The three exercises in the [lab manual](../Lab.md) share the same starter project and haven't involved any code change but configuration changes.
[helloworld-webpart](./helloworld-webpart) can be used as both starter project and completed code.

To build and run the demo project(s), open a Command Window and execute the following commands:

````shell
npm insall
gulp clean
gulp serve
````
