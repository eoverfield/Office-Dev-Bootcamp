## Demos

This directory contains the completed code for each exercise in the [lab manual](../Lab.md).  If you do not want to go through all the steps for each exercise in the lab manual you may run the completed code samples.  

Keep in mind, some code configuration settings may be required to make the samples run and execute like the lab manuals demonstrate.  Refer to the [lab manual](../Lab.md) for each exercise for more details.

[Exercise 1](./Exercise 1)
[Exercise 2](./Exercise 2)

To build and run the demo project(s), open a Command Window and execute the following commands:

````shell
npm insall
gulp clean
gulp serve
````
